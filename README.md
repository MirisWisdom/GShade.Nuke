# GShade Nuke Utility

In light of the [recent](https://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-14-gshade-mod-twitter-trend-developer-malware/) [GShade](https://www.fanbyte.com/games/news/gshade-malware-controversy-ffxiv-third-party-tool/) ["malware" incident](https://piunikaweb.com/2023/02/07/psa-gshade-contains-malware-install-reshade-before-uninstalling/), this project aims to completely uninstall GShade from your system in a thorough yet reliable manner.

1. It will completely back up all of the GShade data to an archive, for preservation and restoration; and
2. It will completely erase the installation files from your system, to ensure that no traces of it remain.

The official GShade uninstaller has two caveats:

1. It seemingly requires you to be updated to the latest version of GShade, thereby opening up a potential attack vector to further malicious malware; and
2. Whether it's a partial uninstallation or unwanted side-effects, there is no guarantee that the uninstaller will do one thing to the fullest extent: remove the GShade files.
